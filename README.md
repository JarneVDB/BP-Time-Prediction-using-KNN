# BP-Time-Prediction-using-KNN
This is the code to evaluate an enhancement of the prediction algorithm as discussed by Rogge-Solti and Weske to predict the remaining time of running process instances. More details can be found in our master thesis "Enhancing Stochastic Petri Net-based Remaining Time Prediction using k-Nearest Neighbor Clustering"
